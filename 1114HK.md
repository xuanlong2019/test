## Contribution Guides
In the spirit of open source software development,jQuery always encourages community code contribution.To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. Getting Involved
2. Core Style Guide
3. Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects
## Environments in which to use jQuery
* Browser support
* jQuery also supports Node,browser extensions,and other non-brower environments.
## What you need to build your own jQuery
To build jQuery,you need to have the latest Node.js/npm and git 1.7 or later.Earlier versions might work, but are not supported.

For Windows,you have to download and install git and Node.js.

OS X users should install Homebrew.Once Homebrew is installed,run ```brew install git```
to install git,and ``` brew install node``` to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js,or build from from source if you swing  that way.Easy-peasy.
## How to build your own jQuery
Clone a copy of the main jQuery git repo by running:
```
git clone git://github.com/jquery/jquery.git
```
Enter the jquery directory and run the build script:
```
cd jquery && npm run build
```
The build version of jQuery will be put in the ```dist/``` subdirectory,alone with the minified copy and associated map file.

 If you want to create custom build or help with jQuery development,it would be better to install grunt command line interface as a global package:
 ```
 npm install -g grunt-cli
 ```
 Make sure you have ```grunt``` installed by testing:
 ```
 grunt - V
 ```
 Now by running the ``` grunt ``` command,in the jquery directory,you can build a full version of jQuery,jusst like with an ``` npm run build``` command:
 ```
 grunt
 ```
 There are many other tasks available for jQuery Core:
 ```
 grunt -help
 ```
 ### Modules
 Special builds can be created that exclude subsets of jQuery functionality. This allows for smaller custom builds when the builder is certain that those parts of jQuery are not being used. For example, an app that only used JSONP for ```$.ajax()``` and did not need to calculate offsets or positions of elements could exclude the offset and ajax/xhr modules.

Any module may be excluded except for ```core```, and ```selector```. To exclude a module, pass its path relative to the ```src``` folder (without the ```.js ```extension).

Some example modules that can be excluded are:

* **ajax**: All AJAX functionality: $.ajax(), $.get(), $.post(), $.ajaxSetup(), .load(), transports, and ajax event shorthands such as .ajaxStart().

* **ajax/xhr**: The XMLHTTPRequest AJAX transport only.

* **ajax/script**: The ```<script>```  AJAX transport only; used to retrieve scripts.

* **ajax/jsonp**: The JSONP AJAX transport only; depends on the ajax/script transport.

* **css**: The .css() method. Also removes all modules depending on css (including effects, dimensions, and offset).
